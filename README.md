This is similar to one of my assignments from university.

Summary:
I made a role playing game with text files. Practice creating a makefile to compile and clean the output files
created when compiling. I created a player inventory that stores 8 bits representing 8 possible collectable item. 
I used a inventory object to hold information about specific locations when we get there. Depending on the inventory 
of the player we decide whether they recieve information. It's like if they pass a requirement created from the text 
file we deliver information. The important aspects of this project is how to access file information. This is done with 
fgets, fgetc, fopen, fclose, etc. They allow you to increment through and read a file after it's been opened.

Approach:
This is the first time I used VScode so I figured out how to use VScode and learned how to complile on unix.
VScode is basically a notebook that helps autofill information that is needed or tell you what syntax
mistakes you made in code. It was a huge struggle learning to use Vscode because it needed a lot of random 
extensions that you might need to find yourself. Vscode didn't seem to have the standard libraries for C
programming so I added a bunch of extensions until the code worked. Then came unix compilation. Since the 
files are in assembly I needed to figure out how to translate the file data I was recieving.
